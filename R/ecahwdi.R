#' Heat wave duration index wrt mean of reference period
#' 
#' Let infile1 be a time series of the daily maximum temperature TX, and let
#' infile2 be the mean TXnorm of daily maximum temperatures for any period used as
#' reference. Then counted is the number of days where, in intervals of at least
#' nday consecutive days, TX \> TXnorm + T. The numbers nday and T are optional
#' parameters with default nday = 6 and T = 5Â°C. A further output variable is the
#' number of heat waves longer than or equal to nday days. TXnorm is calculated as
#' the mean of maximum temperatures of a five day window centred on each calendar
#' day of a given climate reference period. Note that both TX and TXnorm have to
#' be given in the same units. The date information of a timestep in outfile is
#' the date of the last contributing timestep in infile1.
