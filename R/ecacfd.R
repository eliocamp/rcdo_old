#' Consecutive frost days index per time period
#' 
#' Let infile be a time series of the daily minimum temperature TN, then the
#' largest number of consecutive days where TN \< 0 Â°C is counted. Note that TN
#' have to be given in units of Kelvin. A further output variable is the number of
#' frost periods of more than N days. The date information of a timestep in
#' outfile is the date of the last contributing timestep in infile.
