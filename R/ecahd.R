#' Heating degree days per time period
#' 
#' Let infile be a time series of the daily mean temperature TG, then the heating
#' degree days are defined as the sum of T1 - TG, where only values TG \< T2 are
#' considered. If T1 and T2 are omitted, a temperature of 17Â°C is used for both
#' parameters. If only T1 is given, T2 is set to T1. Note that TG have to be given
#' in units of kelvin, whereas T1 and T2 have to be given in degrees Celsius. The
#' date information of a timestep in outfile is the date of the last contributing
#' timestep in infile.
