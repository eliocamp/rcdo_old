#' Consecutive summer days index per time period
#' 
#' Let infile be a time series of the daily maximum temperature TX, then the
#' largest number of consecutive days where TX \> T is counted. The number T is an
#' optional parameter with default T = 25Â°C. Note that TN have to be given in
#' units of Kelvin, whereas T have to be given in degrees Celsius. A further
#' output variable is the number of summer periods of more than N days. The date
#' information of a timestep in outfile is the date of the last contributing
#' timestep in infile.
