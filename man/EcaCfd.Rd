\description{
Let infile be a time series of the daily minimum temperature TN, then the
largest number of consecutive days where TN \< 0 Â°C is counted. Note that TN
have to be given in units of Kelvin. A further output variable is the number of
frost periods of more than N days. The date information of a timestep in
outfile is the date of the last contributing timestep in infile.
