\description{
This operator performs linear interpolation between two years, timestep by
timestep. The input files need to have the same structure with the same
variables. The output files will be named \<obase\>\<yyyy\>\<suffix\> where
yyyy will be the year and suffix is the filename extension derived from the
file format.
