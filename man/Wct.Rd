\description{
Let infile1 and infile2 be time series of temperature and wind speed records,
then a corresponding time series of resulting windchill temperatures is written
to outfile. The wind chill temperature calculation is only valid for a
temperature of T \<= 33 °C and a wind speed of v \>= 1.39 m/s. Whenever these
conditions are not satisfied, a missing value is written to outfile. Note that
temperature and wind speed records have to be given in units of °C and m/s,
respectively.
