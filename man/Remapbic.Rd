\description{
This module contains operators for a bicubic remapping of fields between grids
in spherical coordinates. The interpolation is based on an adapted SCRIP
library version. For a detailed description of the interpolation method see
SCRIP. This interpolation method only works on quadrilateral curvilinear source
grids.

\preformatted{ remapbic  Bicubic interpolation
           Performs a bicubic interpolation on all input fields.
 genbic    Generate bicubic interpolation weights
           Generates bicubic interpolation weights for the first input field and writes the
           result to a file. The format of this file is NetCDF following the SCRIP convention.
           Use the operator remap to apply this remapping weights to a data file with the same source grid.
