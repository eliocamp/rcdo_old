\description{
Let infile1 be a time series of the daily maximum temperature TX, and let
infile2 be the mean TXnorm of daily maximum temperatures for any period used as
reference. Then counted is the number of days where, in intervals of at least
nday consecutive days, TX \> TXnorm + T. The numbers nday and T are optional
parameters with default nday = 6 and T = 5Â°C. A further output variable is the
number of heat waves longer than or equal to nday days. TXnorm is calculated as
the mean of maximum temperatures of a five day window centred on each calendar
day of a given climate reference period. Note that both TX and TXnorm have to
be given in the same units. The date information of a timestep in outfile is
the date of the last contributing timestep in infile1.
