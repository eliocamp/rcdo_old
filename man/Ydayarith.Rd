\description{
This module performs simple arithmetic of a time series and one timestep with
the same day of year. For each field in infile1 the corresponding field of the
timestep in infile2 with the same day of year is used. The header information
in infile1 have to be the same as in infile2. Usually infile2 is generated by
an operator of the module YDAYSTAT.
