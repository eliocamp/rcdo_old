\description{
Let infile be a time series of the daily maximum temperature TX, then the
largest number of consecutive days where TX \> T is counted. The number T is an
optional parameter with default T = 25Â°C. Note that TN have to be given in
units of Kelvin, whereas T have to be given in degrees Celsius. A further
output variable is the number of summer periods of more than N days. The date
information of a timestep in outfile is the date of the last contributing
timestep in infile.
