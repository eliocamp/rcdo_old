\description{
This module performs simple arithmetic of a time series and one timestep with
the same month of year. For each field in infile1 the corresponding field of
the timestep in infile2 with the same month of year is used. The header
information in infile1 have to be the same as in infile2. Usually infile2 is
generated by an operator of the module YMONSTAT.
