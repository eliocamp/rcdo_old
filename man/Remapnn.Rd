This module contains operators for a nearest neighbor remapping of fields
between grids in spherical coordinates.

\details{
\preformatted{ remapnn  Nearest neighbor remapping
          Performs a nearest neighbor remapping on all input fields.
 gennn    Generate nearest neighbor remap weights
          Generates nearest neighbor remapping weights for the first input field and writes the result to a file.
          The format of this file is NetCDF following the SCRIP convention.
          Use the operator remap to apply this remapping weights to a data file with the same source grid.
