\description{
Let infile1 be a time series of the daily minimum temperature TN and infile2 be
a corresponding series of daily surface snow amounts. Then the number of days
where TN \< 0 Â°C and the surface snow amount is less than 1 cm is counted. The
temperature TN have to be given in units of Kelvin. The date information of a
timestep in outfile is the date of the last contributing timestep in infile.
