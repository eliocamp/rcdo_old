\description{
Let infile1 be a time series RR of the daily precipitation amount at wet days
(precipitation \>= 1 mm) and infile2 be the 90th percentile RRn90 of the daily
precipitation amount at wet days for any period used as reference. Then the
ratio of the precipitation sum at wet days with RR \> RRn90 to the total
precipitation sum is calculated. RRn90 is calculated as the 90th percentile of
all wet days of a given climate reference period. Usually infile2 is generated
by the operator ydaypctl,90. The date information of a timestep in outfile is
the date of the last contributing timestep in infile1.
