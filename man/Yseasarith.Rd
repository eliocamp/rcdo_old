\description{
This module performs simple arithmetic of a time series and one timestep with
the same season. For each field in infile1 the corresponding field of the
timestep in infile2 with the same season is used. The header information in
infile1 have to be the same as in infile2. Usually infile2 is generated by an
operator of the module YSEASSTAT.
