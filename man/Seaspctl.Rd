\description{
This operator computes percentiles over all timesteps in infile1 of the same
season. The algorithm uses histograms with minimum and maximum bounds given in
infile2 and infile3, respectively. The default number of histogram bins is 101.
The default can be overridden by defining the environment variable
CDO_PCTL_NBINS. The files infile2 and infile3 should be the result of
corresponding seasmin and seasmax operations, respectively. The time of outfile
is determined by the time in the middle of all contributing timesteps of
infile1. This can be change with the CDO option --timestat_date
\<first|middle|last\>. Be careful about the first and the last output timestep,
they may be incorrect values if the seasons have incomplete timesteps. For
every adjacent sequence t_1, ...,t_n of timesteps of the same season it is:
